Phone Use in India - Analysis using Python

🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze mobile phone usage trends in India, focusing on data consumption, social media usage, and age-wise behavior. Through data analysis and visualization, we uncover patterns that define modern digital habits.

📊 Key Focus Areas:

📶 Average data usage across different age groups
⏳ Daily time spent on social media
📈 Trends in mobile usage behavior
🚀 Technologies & Libraries Used
Python 🐍
Pandas, NumPy – Data processing & analysis
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook – Interactive exploration
📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
✔️ Age-wise phone usage data (data consumption, social media time)
✔️ Distribution of social media time (hours per day)
✔️ Trends in mobile habits based on age

📊 Key Insights & Findings
🔹 The 20-30 age group consumes the highest data (25.6 GB/month on avg.)
🔹 Most users spend 2-4 hours daily on social media
🔹 Data consumption drops significantly for users aged 60+
🔹 A steady decline in mobile usage with increasing age

📌 These insights can be useful for telecom companies, digital marketers, and policymakers to understand user behavior and optimize their strategies.

🎯 Future Scope & Improvements
💡 Incorporate machine learning models to predict future phone usage trends
📊 Include regional comparisons to analyze variations in mobile behavior
📱 Expand dataset to cover more detailed app usage statistics

📌 Conclusion
This project provides an in-depth analysis of India's mobile usage trends, offering valuable insights into how different age groups interact with digital platforms. The findings can help businesses, telecom companies, and digital marketers shape better data-driven decisions.
